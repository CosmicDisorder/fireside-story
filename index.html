        <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
        <p>The city was silent save for the keening hum of the frigid winter
          wind.</p>
        <p>This scene remained still, save the occasional blurp of a wayward
          keystroke...
        </p><br>
        <p>. . . Keystroke? "Oh no!" Jack cried, as he leapt up from his
          computer, rubbing at the imprint his keyboard had left on his cheek.
           "I overslept---and today's the day of the meeting!"</p>
           <p>
               Jack's sudden movement startles his cat, Gary, who also sleeping
               was nestled up on the mousepads.
           </p>
        <p>"Whoops, sorry, Felix!" he said, as he threw on his jacket, grabbed
          his laptop, and flew out the door.</p>
